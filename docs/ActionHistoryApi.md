# **delete_action_instance**
> delete_action_instance(action_instance_id, var_from, to)

Deletes an automation action run result from the action run history by ID.

Deletes the automation action run result specified in the request path from the action run history.

# **get_action_instance**
> ActionInstance get_action_instance(action_instance_id, window_size=window_size, to=to)

Get the details of an automation action run result by ID from action run history.

Get the details of automation action run result specified in the request path from action run history. The automation action run result will be fetched only if the action run result was created within the timeframe specified by the `windowSize` and `to` query parameters. The `windowSize` parameter is used to compute the from date (`from = to - windowSize`) of the timeframe. The default value for `windowSize` is 10 minutes and the default value for `to` is current system time. To get the automation action run result ID and the created time, you can run `/api/automation/actioninstances` REST calls. When using personal access tokens, the user must have at least `Viewer` access for Automation.

Get the details of automation action run results from action run history.

Get the details of automation action run results from action run history. The results are filtered by the filters in the query parameters. The automation action run result will be fetched only if the action run results were created within the timeframe specified by the `windowSize` and `to` query parameters. The `windowSize` parameter is used to compute the from date (`from = to - windowSize`) of the timeframe. The default value for `windowSize` is 10 minutes and the default value for `to` is current system time. When using personal access tokens, the user must have at least `Viewer` access for Automation and the automation action run results returned are also filtered based on the access set in `Limited access` permission settings. This API returns paginated result as specified in query parameters `page` and `pageSize`. The response contains list of automation action run results whose contents corresponds to the `page` query parameter and whose size corresponds to the `pageSize` query parameter.
